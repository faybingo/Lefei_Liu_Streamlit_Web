Su barba me gusta y es sanísima pero debe quitarse todas estas cosas de la boca las cuales pueden hacer que se atragante o se le metan en el estomago si se despegan por mala suerte. Debe dejar de beber un tiempo y de fumar también. Creo que ha bebido mucho y a fumado mucho también. Necesita un descanso. La cama ayuda con las adicciones como el tabaco, quédate en la cama unos días y intenta apartarte de las rutinas que mezclabas con el tabaco un par de días, levántate par ir al baño y moverte un poco ya que tampoco es bueno estar estirado todo el tiempo y hay que respirar aire de la calle cada ciertas horas también. Yo empezaría con el alcohol y date una semana de fumar para no quitar tantas cosas de golpe, si fumas petas pues fúmate uno por la noche de vez en cuando si tienes mucho mono pero el tabaco fuera unos días para empezar, seguro que recaes pero a la semana lo vuelves a intentar y se consigue. También tienes que luchar con tu mente ya que de vez en cuando te dice que un cigarro no pasa nada y seguramente que no pasa nada pero mejor negarte y aguantar. Ya volverás a fumar mas adelante cuando estés limpio. Esta claro que todo esto es adaptable a cada persona pero a mi es lo que me funciona. Yo llevo dos días o tres sin fumar y hoy ya me apetecía de verdad uno pero me niego, eso si, mañana me fumo uno porque es navidad pero con negarme hoy ya veo que podre conseguirlo sin mucha dificultad, a partir de mañana lo alargaremos a una semana mínimo.",True

I love all of your collabs, EXCEPT for one… dare I say? I’m pretty sure most people know which one I’m talking about.I wish you would’ve done that track on your own, I mean, you pretty did anyway…) 
And 21 Savage - I’ve been following him him since the beginning, long ago. His voice is unique & I love it - I can list a ton of collabs that rock my world ( Ozzy, Halsey.)

You’re facking amazing, but you already know that. A heart of gold, compassionate, engaging.  
Amazing Album - this has a deep, personal vibe & I love the richness in your voice, the deeper, darker chords that are used give me chills, the emotion is powerful. You’ve grown so much with your music & as an artist. - Hollywood’s Bleeding is still my favourite albumn and of course several songs from Stoney & B&B. I can’t wait to see what you create next.

@SM-yu4hd,2023-11-10T21:41:50Z,0,"Trust in Jesus, Hell is real and eternal! This is what the Bible says about it.. 
""The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13: 41-42
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven ""I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.""  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! 
""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. ""Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..""(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, ""God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. God is deadly serious about sin, when we genuinely repent we hate sin just as God hates it, and we turn away from it.
""But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.
""For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.

Eye for or an eye or was it tooth for a tooth? They convince us to eat the rich. So they can take it from the youth. You can’t even get the truth when you turn on any news. It’s just another made up problem so they can never fix that too. It’s a never ending cycle; conspiracies keep coming true. Do we want Ukraine to win? Because that’s pure revenue. Selling the bullets, and the bandaids. The hardest part was selling you. 

Take a breath. Clear my lungs then it's fight or flight. 
How the fuck did we end up bombing nations in another oil fight.
 To prove to who? To prove to you you’ve got American rights

Please explain to me how tf freedom came to be in a country that isn’t even my own home. Then I gotta pay just so I can phone home.
Tell mommy goodbye forever from a fucking  wall phone. Add a dime before the time or there’s a dial tone. 

That's the issue with the draft free social justice population. They get their social clicks and little kicks by starting wars for generations. 
Every time these puppet pricks marches to their lil stages grab a mic and speak polite they swear they'll raise your wages, but how longs it been since you’ve seen their faces. Usually around the races, Load decks all aces they wave it in your fuckin faces a messy hell the United States is. 
You can help but bow you fucking culture vultures, always screaming conflict, confrontation 
Start a war, without known location half of you can't even name. The governments the one to blame ask the Russians why theyd take Ukraine, third ones the charm are they that insane. So I had to clear my mind and ask lady liberty how would she feel, she asked me for spare change she’s just another dope sick female.",True

Я вот думаю, неужели  так дорого приходится платить за талант?? За славу и известность.
Каждому человеку  дается определенный сгусток энергии. Ну, или другими словами, время , отпущенное на жизнь.
И.. хотелось бы понять. Это судьба или все-таки выбор человека ускорить достижение славы приводит к потери здоровья, а иногда целой  жизни?

Хотя да. Скорее всего человек сам выбирает.

Кто-то  ради цели несется сломя голову и в итоге вместо радости получает страдания.
Такова цена.

Ну.. когда, Кто-то  сходит с ума ради достижения  цели..
 И не понимает,  что цель это всего лишь мотив причина к движению.

А иначе как стать мудрее?
И кто  вместо того, что бы проживать каждую минуту делая постоянно осознанный выбор, закрывает глаза  думая , что полет к звездам- это и есть настоящий  кайф...

Заканчивает ..вот так иногда наркозависимостью.

@user-jz2bq3xw9u,2023-09-21T22:33:32Z,0,"Trust in Jesus, Hell is real and eternal! This is what the Bible says about it.. 
""The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."" Matthew 13: 41-42
Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven ""I am the way, the truth, and the life no one comes to the father but by me.""  John 14:6   Ask God to reveal this to you- He will! 
""For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."" Romans 3:23 ADMIT THAT YOU'RE A SINNER. We've all broken God's laws and ten commandments.. ""Thou shalt not lie, steal, covet, dishonor parents, take God's name in vain..""(Exodus 20) We do not have righteousness on our own to get to heaven, ""God made him (Jesus) who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."" 2 Cor. 5:21 Godly sorrow leads to genuine repentance for sinning against the righteous God and there is a change of heart, we change our mind and God changes our hearts and regenerates us from the inside out. God is deadly serious about sin, when we genuinely repent we hate sin just as God hates it, and we turn away from it.
""But God commended His love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us."" Romans 5:8 BELIEVE IN YOUR HEART THAT JESUS CHRIST DIED FOR YOUR SINS, WAS BURIED, AND THAT GOD RAISED JESUS FROM THE DEAD. This is trusting with all of your heart that Jesus Christ is who he said he was. He saves us from sin and hell and brings us into a relationship with him. We become God's children. We are saved from hell, eternal death.
""For whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved."" Romans 10:13 CALL UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD. Every single person who ever lived since Adam will bend their knee and confess with their mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, the Lord of Lords and the King of Kings.
Read the Bible, Walk with the Lord and give your life to Him!",True

And I was listening to this album every single day on repeat through it. I think I have to say… this might be one of my favorite albums of all time and it hurts so much that I can’t listen to it right now because of the pain associated. I hope as I heal it will become less painful for me to listen to this album considering I love it so much and it means so much to me.

0:16 Overdrive
Lyrics:
I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so overtired
And there's nowhere I can hide
Now I live my life on overdrive
I could be more like him
If that's cool with you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you
I spend my nights on overdrive
I live my life so uninspired
There ain't no angels in this world
So I live my life on overdrive
I'd remove my tattoos
If that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you
Cool to you, uh
I could end it with her
If that's cool to you
I'd do anything to be cool to you

3:12 Green Thumb
Lyrics:
Da-da, da-dum
Drove by your house and noticed it was overgrown
Your flowers are all dead, and I thought you should know
What happened to your green thumb that you were so proud of?
The bodies were scattered and starving for love
Starving for love
But one, one, one was on his deathbed
He told me you left long ago, oh, no
He said, with his last breath
""Wake up, she's not coming home""
Da-da, da-dum
He must be so cool and on a motorcycle
Buy you new flowers to replace what you left
My new love pours herself out more than I like
Her name is Brandy, we'll be married tonight
Married tonight
When I, I, I, I'm on my deathbed
I'll remember you left long ago, oh no
I hear the nurse say
""Goodnight, she's never coming home""

6:42 Something Real
Lyrics:
Give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
Seven hundred feet off the coast of Greece
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
No reservation, pull up twenty deep
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I would trade it all just to be at peace
Stop, the gear's too high, this is overload
And no matter what car is sittin' outside, it's a lonely road
It's a double-edge sword, cuttin' off ties with the ones I know
So tell me, how the fuck am I still alive? It's a miracle, oh
and I can't believe, ran through a B at Louis V
It's what I need right now
(No-o-o) it's just money at the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line
So give me somethin' I can feel
720S, 750V
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I was in Maldives sippin' burgundy
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeve
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I could play that pussy like it's ""Für Elise""
I got real habits, I'm a snowmobile addict
Teal Patek, steel when I feel panic, ah-ah, ahh
Throw a mil' at it, problem, throw a pill at it
Still at it, sign-another-deal addict (ah-ah, ah)
And I can't believe everybody gets to drink for free
So give me one more round (oh-oh-oh)
No cover fee at the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line
So give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
How much psilocybin can a human eat?
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
And it's what I want, it ain't what I need
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah, ooh)
Got everything, guess I'm hard to please
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah, ooh)
I would trade my life just to be at peace
Give me somethin' I can feel (ah, ooh)
Give me somethin', somethin' real",True

In 2019, he released Hollywood Bleeding in early September when I was leaving France and my dad while not knowing I would stay 3 years not seeing him (I live in China, and Covid would stop all possibility of travel only a few months later). Post released Twelve Carat Toothache last year just when my dad was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer and Austin came out less than a month after my dad passed away. I don't believe in any sign or anything, but all of this gave Postie's songs a very deep meaning in my heart.",True

E levítico algum lugarzinho la

Claro qui vc dizer aí vava né 
Tá alertando quem seja 
Mais 
Lembra da mulher adúltera ?
Qui não sei onde tá escritim 
Mais tá 
Se ninguém tiver pecados 
Qui atire a primeira Pedra 
E 
Olha 
Tudo antes do véu ser rasgado 
Era tudo muito severo 
Vc iria pedir a Deus pra ele existir Memo e viver nesse século 
É 
Esse século qui se pode tudinho 
Tudinho 
A grande cidadanias 
Direitos e deveres 
É 
Liberdade de expressão
É
Sabia que nos tempos passados 
Não sei qual 
Se dos romanos 
Ou no século dos reis 
É 
Tudo era tão severo 
Como ter que comer uma folha de boldo toda horinha 
Qui se cometesse um deslize 
É
Sabia qui em umas monarca 
Coroa era uma terra de leis ,
Muitas delas eram focadas na família e no casamento.
No melhor dos casos , 
Cometer adultério faria a pessoa se exilada .
No pior , ela era levada para a torre .
O divórcio era uma coisa tão rara que não se via nenuumzinho acontecer  
É 
E sabia
Qui podia umas irem até a forca 
Cortava se até os pescocinhos delas 
É 
O caso era tão severamente severo 
Qui eu ainda tremo qui não sou 
Daquele século
É
Tá escritim pra todos nois 
Nossos pecados capitais 
E pessoais 
Então não precisa 
Ninguém nos acusar 
Porque 
Somos é todos uns montin de pecadores nós próprios pecados 
É
Sabia que na Grécia 
Sei lá se é lá Memo 
Um grego não pode se divorciar
É
Sabia qui eu vou mi divorciar 
É
Mais se Deus permitir
Com a razão minha 
E a dele juntos 
É 
E não devemos 
Difamar ninguém 
Nem essa aí vava
E nem fazer. Calúnias 
Se isso acontecer 
Dize pessoalmente pra pessoa 
É
Sabia qui eu até acho 
Que vc pós mAlone 
Já foi lá em Las Vegas
É 
Não sei porque 
Mais presumo qui foi 
É 
Vc e mais um monti deles 
O 50 cent 
Tem cara de Las Vegas
É
O Barry white não tem 
Mais penso que foi lá também
Se sabe né 
Nunca pelo só jogos .da roleta 
Russa 
Mais pelo jogo do prazer 
Então 
Não se diz vadia 
Quando se  saiu com elas 
E vc possa ser tão quanto 
Um vadio como elas 
Se ia curtir mais como ??
Se eu falar assim 
Oi mAlone
Ou oi 
Vadio 
Sei lá 
É a expressão de agora 
Né 
A cidadania
Os direitos e deveres
Mas tolerância 
Sabia qui é respeito
Mas olha 
Vc canta muito
Mais eu sei que repers
As letras são assim Memo 
Eu sei 
Lonje de se uma ignorante
Mais sei qui essa expressão 
É uma giria 
E como vc como eu 
Somos extrangeiros
Não devemos 
Desprezar os Extrangeiros
Porque também fomos 
Extrangeiros na terra do Egito
É
E seja bem vindo aqui no Brasil
Vc e suas músicas
Eu ainda fico 
Com nota 10
Pra 
Post mAlone maloninho iverson
Mas também a letra 
É como si diz 
Aí uma giria
Da pesada né 
E eu não cometi adultério 
Nem eu que isso 
É 
Mas me separei 
Anos 
E vivia com meu ex 
Como amigos
Na mesma casa 
Então eu penso que podia 
Olhar pro Jean Martin
Né 
Mas se fosse no tempos da brilhantina 
Ou dos monarca 
Eu ia ser exilada 
Que nem sendo casada qui virou amigos morando na mesma casa 
O rei da persia ia deixar 
Isso como comum né 

Como si diz agora 
Na época da Coca cola 
Tudo é leberal 
Cuidado nem tudo 
Porisso sivira 
Ler as escrituras
Já que vc é um compositor
Tial 
E mais uma coisinha 
Nossa 
Vc não nada nessa piscina 
Ou ela é só de enfeites
Se sabia 
Qui todos que tem uma piscina 
Não as usa 
É
Dificilmente
Se vc precisar de uma segurança noturna aí pra vigiar o quintal 
Me contrata 
É 
E se vc tiver pãozinho caseiro e pãozinho de queijo
E bolo recheado
E bolos de tudinho tipos 
Me contrata qui eu faço 
Com prazer a segurança
Qui sinto muita fomes é
Meu pai morava numa fazenda do fazendeiro 
É
Cuidando de tudinho
Mas ele 
Dizia pra nois assim 
Há 
Há 
Se eu ver vocês pedindo 
Um docinho 
Há 
Vcs vão apanhar

Sem vadias 
E eu ia comendo os chocolatinhos
Na fábrica de chocolate

Um daqueles chocolate
Da fábrica de chocolate.

Fora ia dormir aí Memo 
Comendo meu chocolatinho

Qui tenho um sério 
Probrema com 
Esta preso 
Ficar preso 
Sentir se preso 
Tem dia qui se eu não saio todo dia 
Pra respirar 
Passo muito mal

Detesto casa com janelinhas 
Quase odeio 
Eu gosto de lugar qui respirar
É quase como se sentir o.
Nilo passando do lado de fora da sua casa

Eu converso assim 
Porque aderir meu tratamento.por conta própria 
Contra a depressão

Isso ajuda eu nao 
Me auto medicar . é

Ser sensível 
Em me aceitar ouvir 
Obrigada pelo carinho de deixar eu te escrever sem me bloquear
Obrigada por vc ser gentil
